## 💬 About

Lumina bridges the gap between technology and emotional well-being. Rather than a generic chatbot, Lumina lets users choose a **relationship persona** — a Mom, Dad, or Friend — and even **clone a real voice** using an uploaded audio sample. The result is a deeply personal companion that speaks to you the way the people you love do.

Built for students, individuals managing stress, and anyone who needs a safe, judgment-free space to be heard.
